# Mrecipes 

## __PROJECT OVERVIEW__
This is my third of four projects within the CodeInstitute course. In this project I focused on using Python
along with other coding languages such as HTML and CSS to create a web page which is capable of storing 
recipes within a Database. I then ensured that the Recipe entries are able to be 
1. Created
1. Readable
1. Updated
1. Deleted
 
by anyone (users) who have access to the website. I also wanted the users to have the option to use the 
website as a 'recipe-book' style website, allowing for them to search for a specific recipe or just 
generally browse through the recipes to find one in which they wish to use. 

## __UX DESIGN__ 
* This site was created with the intention of allowing suers to search for and find recipes for different
dishes throughout the world. 'Mrecipes' is typically aimed at the people who wish to learn how to cook
i.e. non experienced cooks. Mrecipes allows users to use CRUD features in order to showcase recipes, 
or find recipes. Having CRUD features allows for the website to be in control of the users. My project
best allows users to find recipes as the entire site is dedicated to just that; Recipes!
