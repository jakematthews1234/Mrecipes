"# Mrecipes" 

## __project overview__
This is my third of four projects within the CodeInstitute course. In this project I focused on using Python
along with other coding languages such as HTML and CSS to create a web page which is capable of storing 
recipes within a Database. I then ensured that the Recipe entries are able to be 
1. Created
1. Readable
1. Updated
1. Deleted
 
by anyone (users) who have access to the website. I also wanted the users to have the option to use the 
website as a 'recipe-book' style website, allowing for them to search for a specific recipe or just 
generally browse through the recipes to find one in which they wish to use.
